# React Practice Repository

This repository contains a series of practice projects built with **React.js**, organized into branches. Each branch demonstrates a specific concept, ranging from the basics like components and state, to advanced topics like routing, custom hooks, and API interaction.

Every branch is focused and isolated to keep learning modular and progressive.
